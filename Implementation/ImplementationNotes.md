A place to keep random notes about the planned Implementation.


## VDepth and Cycles

While Each section of the VSA will output one result every cycle, the VDepth defines a 'cadence' of those results.

So, even if something could process inputs faster, like, every 3 cycles, etc, it's probably better to keep it on the VDepth cycle, because, it
s imputs will probably be coming on the same VDepth Cycles.
