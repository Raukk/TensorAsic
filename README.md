MobilenetV2: 1/2 Million images per second

Have I got your attention?


# Goal
The Goal of this project is to develop the design of an ASIC for processing Deep Learning Tensors with high efficiency. The primary end goal is the creation of a reference design, including the interface and ops that is completely open source. 


# Commercial Use
Contact for explanation of conditions.


# Approach
First, a basic processing unit will be architected and designed, before going to early stage development.
Once the basic processing unit Has been defined, much of the remaining implementation design must be started, this includes data storage, IO, Interface, Instruction set, Operations, etc.  


# Current status
Currently, a high level design for the basic processing unit has been created.
Additionally, weaknesses in existing designs have been evaluated. 


# License
The current license is AGPL, I will provide more information on that choice.
Once the Primary goal of creating a full open-source Reference design is completed, the license will be changed to CC0/Public Domain.
