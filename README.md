# TensorAsic

A high level design for a tensor processing ASIC.


# Sales Pitch

MobilenetV2: 1/2 Million images per second

Have I got your attention?


# Goal

The Goal of this project is to develop the design of an ASIC for processing Deep Learning Tensors with high efficiency. 

The primary end goal is the creation of a reference design, including the interface and ops that is completely open source. 


# Commercial Use

Contact for explanation of conditions.


# Current status

Currently, a high level design for the basic processing unit has been created.

## Evaluation of Systolic Arrays

[This document](https://github.com/Raukk/TensorAsic/blob/master/TpuStrengthsWeaknesses.md) goes over a basic evaluation of the standard implementation of a Systolic Array such as the ones used in Google's TPU.

## The "Virtual Systolic Array Unit" (VSA Unit)

The [VSA Unit](https://github.com/Raukk/TensorAsic/blob/master/VSAUnitDefinition.md) is the core variation from existing architectures  like a Standard Systolic Array. 

## Full Reference Implementation

This is the primary goal of this project, but is only just in the initial stages.
